# Get started

- First you must run the gen_test_vec notebook to generate all of the header files needed in the kernel.
- The paths in the kernel will have to be updated to your own since they are absolute currently.
- You don't need to generate testvectors, precomputed testvector are already included, but you could if you want to.
- The example is currently built for lengths 4..8 but it can be changed with the lengths_to_use in the notebook.
- Any questions, send us an email
